# Python-Projects: Showcasing My Python Journey
Welcome to my Python-Projects repository, curated by David Lewis. Here, I aim to demonstrate my evolving Python skills and abilities, providing a glimpse of what I can offer to prospective employers.
#
# About Me and My Python Journey:
My journey with Python began during my Cybersecurity bootcamp at PwC. The initial encounter was a whirlwind, a two-day crash course that left me more bewildered than enlightened. However, I'm not one to back down from a challenge, and I'm currently on the path of mastery through the Codecademy Learn Python course.
#
# What Lies Ahead:
My future in Python involves a fascinating twist, diving into the world of ethical hacking. I'm gearing up to explore Python for Ethical Hacking, a course that will equip me with the skills to script powerful tools and automate intricate processes. Expect to witness the transformation as I hone my craft in this thrilling domain.
#
So, sit back, relax, and join me on this exhilarating journey as I document my progress in mastering Python for ethical hacking.
#
Cheers!
